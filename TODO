* Experiment with `setscrreg`, `wsetscrreg` and `scrollok` functions from
  ncurses. Check their man pages for more information.

* ncdrv.c should be compiled twice generating, `ncdrv.so` and `ncdrvw.so`. The
  later is being built with ncursesw, wide-character version for unicode
  support. This had to be done via rebar(?).

  on the erlang side ncurses interface module must load the correct version of
  the library based on configuration and provide the `_wch` or `wstr` variant
  of APIs.

* Why addchstr variant functions are not working ?

* in ncdrv and color related APIs manager color based on global limits COLORS
  and COLOR_PAIRS.

* gen_server:start_link does not fail with error messages. It passes the error
  to supervisor that simly shutsdown.
